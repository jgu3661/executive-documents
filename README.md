This program uses Selenium WebDriver, which requires an [executable](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/) specific to the browser in use. The appropriate download for Firefox, the browser this program uses, can be found [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). You can also use other browsers by installing the [appropriate executable](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/#quick-reference) and updating the relevant lines in `main.py`.

Create a `.env` file in the main directory and set your `HARVARDKEY_USERNAME`, `HARVARDKEY_PASSWORD`, and `WEBDRIVER_PATH` (the path to the executable you downloaded above.)
